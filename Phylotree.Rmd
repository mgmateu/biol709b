###I'm trying to make a phylogenetic tree at the Order level, and that will also show the abundance of each order of fungal endophytes for native and invasive Phragmites. I have a separate file with the tree that I merged into the Phyloseq file that has the taxonomy, sample data and OTU table. The issue I'm having is that I can't get the tree to show the right taxonomic name, only the label based on the OTU table. Here are my codes and the files are on Github:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(phyloseq)
library(ape)

its<-import_biom('/Users/Martina/Desktop/BIOL709B class/Project_ITS/OTU_biom_ITS/otu_table_mcw_w_env_metadata_and_tax.biom')

tree=read.tree('/Users/Martina/Desktop/BIOL709B class/Project_ITS/all_samples_its.fna_rep_set_aligned.tre')

phylotree<-merge_phyloseq(its, tree)

colnames(tax_table(phylotree))<-c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus","Species")

order<-subset_taxa(phylotree, Order=all)
order_glom=tax_glom(order, 'Order')
plot_tree(order_glom,color="Lineage", size='abundance',label.tips='taxa_names')
```
